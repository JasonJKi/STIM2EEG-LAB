# STIM2EEG-LAB OBS Synchronization test
# The goal of utilizing OBS studio with labstreaming layer is to time lock each frame of the stimulus with eeg recording. Upon rendering of individual frame to the screen from obs studio, lab streaming layer sends a stream containing frame time and frame number to the Lab Recorder, data acquisition software, using tcp/ip protocol. Each stream is timestamped using operating systems time clock which is used time aligining  Each    
The **stimulus to eeg lab** (STIM2EEG-LAB) is a stimulus capture and display system developed for EEG data collection using [labstreaming layer(lsl)](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer) and [psychtoolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org/)

The STIM2EEG-LAB consists of:

A suite of libs and executables for lsl
   * [LabRecorder](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer/wiki/LabRecorder.wiki), central data acquisition software for all experiment data
   * [BrainAmpSeries](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer/wiki/BrainAmpSeries.wiki), eeg acquisition for Brain Product eeg acquisition system
   * [vis_stream](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer/wiki/ViewingStreamsInMatlab.wiki), matlab interface for visualizing incoming data
   * the core transport library (liblsl) to read and analyze xdf files
   
And [StimulusPlayer](https://github.com/JasonJKi/STIM2EEG-LAB/tree/master/StimulusPlayer) written in Matlab for displaying stimulus and sending timed trigger.
